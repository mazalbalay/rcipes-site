# rcipes-site

A recipe project that combines the use of an external API.
My goal was to use one template and change information as needed.
In addition, take care of a convenient user interface, for example a button to return to the beginning of the page or to load the page before the information appears.
A note about the API:
This is a heavy and massive API, so it may sometimes be necessary to refresh if the information does not appear.
When filling out the contact form, the details are sent to me directly,
So that you can leave me messages..
